# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Description

This project is a CMS-style blog site that allows developers to publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts and opinions about various tech-related topics. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and incorporates technologies like Handlebars.js, Sequelize (as the Object-Relational Mapping tool), and express-session for authentication. The application allows users to create accounts, publish blog posts, comment on existing posts, and manage their posts through a dashboard.
